
Scope:
This model recognizes traffic symbols based on image loaded.
We classify these traffic symbols using CNN and CV2 techniques.

Result:
Hence we got a good accuracy (95% approx) using CNN techniques.
We can further improve accuracy by tuning hyperparameteres with Keras tuner 
and implementing data augmentation techniques.
