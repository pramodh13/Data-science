
Scope:
This model uses ANN binary classification technique to predict if the bank customers 
are leaving the bank or not i.e Customer Churn prediction using the available input data.

Result:
We achieved a accuracy of 85 percent, which is pretty good. This further can be improved by hyper parameter finetuning 
or try adding dropout function for layers.
