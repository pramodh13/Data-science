
Scope:
This model recognizes car brands based on image loaded.
Car brand classification project using transfer learning technique ResNet50 architecture.

Result:
Hence we got a decent accuracy (80% approx) using Resnet architecture. 
This accuracy can be improved by adding more images to train set and test set.
